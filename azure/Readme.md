By the end of Part III, you will have gained technical knowledge and hands-on experience with the different technologies for developing applications with AI, ML, big data, and cloud security in Microsoft Azure. These will help you choose what Azure technology to use for your business requirements and how to develop solutions with them.

Part IV: Integration, Infrastructure, and DevSecOps
This book’s fourth part will teach you how to integrate Azure technologies with other services, use infrastructure as code solutions, and set up your application using Azure’s deployment technologies.

Chapter 10, “Azure Cloud Integration Services and Tools”, focuses on Microsoft Azure integration services. In this chapter, you will learn about the different cloud technologies you can integrate with your cloud-native applications, including existing ones (on the cloud or on premises). This chapter covers Azure API Management, Azure Logic Apps, Azure Web PubSub, Azure Service Bus, Azure Event Grid, Azure Logic Apps, etc.

Chapter 11, “Cloud Infrastructure, DevOps, and Monitoring in Azure”, guides you on how to develop systems or applications with modern DevOps tools. You will learn what DevOps means, and about Azure DevOps, a comprehensive suite for team collaboration for developers and IT operations. You will also learn about automating development processes using CI/CD and source code version control, what Azure Pipelines, GitHub, and Azure DevOps are, and how Azure Monitor and Application Insights are used for troubleshooting Azure resources. You will also learn about other cloud technology services like Azure DevTestLabs, Azure Bicep, ARM templates, and more. You will also learn about infrastructure as code (IaC), policy as code, and configuration as code and how they help with the automation of deployments.

After reading the chapters in Part IV, you will have knowledge and development skills to help you work effectively as a cloud developer using cloud integration and automation options. You and your organization’s Agile team will also be able to collaborate and work effectively using the great features of Azure DevOps, DevTest Labs, GitHub, etc.

Part V: Governance, Migration, Architecture, and Development Tools
The fifth section of this book will give you essential knowledge and tools for adopting and migrating successfully to the cloud.

Chapter 12, “Cloud Management and Governance in Azure”, walks you through the essential concepts regarding cloud management and cloud governance in Microsoft Azure. For example, it covers automation in the cloud, Azure Advisor, backup using Azure Backup, Azure Blueprints, Azure Policy, Azure Monitor, and other known solutions for hybrid and multi-cloud.

Chapter 13, “Cloud Migration, Hybrid, and Multi-Cloud Solutions in Azure”, discusses cloud migration, cloud transformation, and architectural concepts in Microsoft Azure. You will learn the vital facts needed for adopting, transforming, or migrating to Azure. Find out the best practices and a helpful list of tools you can use when moving on premises and handling legacy applications. This chapter also highlights the importance of having Microsoft Azure’s Well-Architected Framework.

Chapter 14, “Cloud Development Tools for Azure”, is more focused on cloud development with Azure. This chapter discusses the different language and cloud development tools you can use to get started with developing modern and resilient applications and solutions on Azure. It covers IDE tools such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Azure Cloud Shell, GitHub Copilot, Codespaces, GitHub CLI, Azure Developer CLI (azd), Microsoft Dev Box, and many more.
