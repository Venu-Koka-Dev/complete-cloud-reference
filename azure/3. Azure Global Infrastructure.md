# I. Key concepts of Azure Global Cloud Infrastructure
 - Key concepts:
    1. Resource - a CPU, RAM, disk, GPU, network related etc.    
    2. Physical Server - has a set of resources (scalable if needed)
    3. Virtual Machine (Node) - using Virtualization tools
    4. Rack - contain rack servers or blade servers along with networking components
    5. Data center - a collection of racks
    6. Cluster - a collection of nodes connected to work on a specific task (these can span from one or more data centers)
      
 - Geo-distribution: Azure helps global enterprises by providing geo-distribution features. Geography-specific endpoints enables international enterprises to comply with regional compliance and regulations

# II. What are Resources in Azure ?
 - In Azure, a resource is a manageable item that is available through Azure
 - Think of it as any service or component you can create, configure, or manage within your Azure subscription
 - Common Examples of Azure Resources:
     1. Virtual Machines (VMs) – for running applications on virtualized hardware.
     2. Storage Accounts – for storing blobs, files, queues, tables, etc.
     3. Web Apps / App Services – for hosting web applications.
     4. Databases – like Azure SQL Database or Cosmos DB.
     5. Virtual Networks (VNets) – for networking and security.
     6. Azure Functions – for running serverless code.
     7. Resource Groups – containers to group multiple resources
  - Resources have associated properties, configurations, costs, and regions
 
  - They can be managed through:
     1. Azure Portal (GUI)
     2. Azure CLI
     3. Azure PowerShell
     4. ARM templates or Bicep (Infrastructure as Code)

  - Resources in Azure can be organized by grouping them into a clearly defined structure for easier management :
     1. Resource Group (can have one or more resources)
     2. Subscription (can have one or more resource groups)
     3. Management Groups (can have one or more subscriptions)

## Example 1: Azure Virtual Machine

## Example 2: Azure Virtual Networks

## Example 3: Azure Storage Account

# III. What is Availability ?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IV. What are Azure Geographies ?
 - Azure divides the world into Geographies—sets of regions grouped together for data residency, sovereignty, and compliance
 - Geo-politcal areas
 - Each Azure geography contains one or more regions and meets specific data residency and compliance requirements. 
 - Ex. India, USA, China, Asia Pacific etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# V. ## What are Azure Regions ?
 - Choosing the right Azure region is also important when it comes to regulatory compliance and data policies such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe
 - Types of Regions:
    a. Regions with Availability Zones (>= 3 zones)
    b. Regions without Availability Zones
 - Some Azure services are non-regional and don't require you to select a specific region or configure availability zone support, meaning they are designed for global availability and don't have a zonal deployment option
 - Examples of Azure Services:
    a. Services that do support Availability Zones (Regional services)
         i. Zonal Services          :  Ex. Azure Virtual Machines  - These services allow us to deploy resources across specific availability zones within a region for enhanced resilience 
        ii. Zone-Redundant Services :  Ex. Azure Storage (Standard, Premium, and Archive tiers)  - These services are automatically replicated across multiple availability zones, ensuring high availability even if one zone experiences an outage  
    b. Services that do not support Availability Zones (Non-regional services) - Ex. Microsoft Entra ID, Azure DevOps - These services are designed to be globally available and don't have a specific region or zone dependency
 - Special Azure Regions: not accessible to general public
     a. US Gov Virginia   - for US government agencies and partners
     b. US Gov Iowa       - for US government agencies and partners
     c. China East        - Partnership between Microsoft & 21Vianet
     d. China North       - Partnership between Microsoft & 21Vianet
     e. Germany Central   - Data trustee model of T-Systems
     f. Germany Northeast - Data trustee model of T-Systems

# VI. What are Availability Zones ?
 - A campus with one or more data centers with independent facilities for power, networking, cooling, and support
Note: A Data center is a secure facility that hosts the “physical” computing, storage, and networking capabilities
      Each data center has independent, isolated, redundant power supplies and cooling systems for resilience against outages
 - These zones are unique physical location or data centers within an Azure region that offer 99.99% SLA for virtual machine uptime
 - These availability zones are connected and equipped with secure high-speed networks, which is important in running mission-critical resources for your computing, networking, storage, and data
 - Availability zones are not available in all regions
   Ex. Central India Region has three AZs,
       South India Region has no AZs
 - Availability options on AZ level is not available in all Azure services
   Ex. Azure Virtual Machine Service has availability option on AZ level
 - Availability zones are used to protect resources from complete system failures in an Azure data center while Availability sets are used to protect applications from hardware failures within an Azure data center

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# VII. What are Azure Regional Pairs ?
 - It involves pairing a region with another region within the same geography but those regions must be at least 300 miles away
   Ex.
 - When possible, Azure prefers this minimum distance between physical data centers in a regional pair in case of natural disasters, widespread power outages, etc.
 - By pairing regions within the same geography, Azure can replicate customer's resources like servers, virtual machines, databases, and storage in another location in case of power outages, natural disasters, etc.
 - If a region in a pair goes down, the services would failover automatically to the other region in its region pair
 - An Azure region usually pairs with another region in the same geography
   Ex. 
 - For example if the region is in Europe, then it is expected that its region pair is also located within Europe
 - Many regions aren't paired, and instead use availability zones as their primary means of redundancy
 - In addition, many Azure services support geo-redundancy whether regions are paired or not
 - Types of Regions:
    1. Paired Regions
         a. Symmetrically paired - means that each region is bidirectionally paired with another region Ex. West US is paired with East US and East US is paired with West US
         b. Asymmetrically paired -  involve regions that are not bidirectionally paired Ex. 
    2. Non-paired regions
  - In the unlikely event of a geography-wide outage, the recovery of one region is prioritized out of every region pair

# VIII. Example 1: India 
1. Azure Geography : India
2. Azure Regions   : 2 running (Central India, South India), 1 announced (India South Central @ Hyderabad)
    a. Central India        @ Pune (With Availability Zones)
    b. South India          @ Chennai (
    c. India South Central  @ Hyderabad (With AZs)

# IX. Example 2: USA 



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# X. What are Edge locations ?
 - They are secure facilities where traffic enters and leaves the Microsoft global network
 - These locations can provide computing resources to be closer to users for improved network latency, allowing fewer network hops through fewer providers
 - If required, the traffic can stay longer on the Microsoft backbone network without transiting the internet
