# Introduction
 - Focuses more on the theoretical and technical concepts of Microsoft Azure as a public cloud platform
 - We will learn about the Microsoft Azure core components and the different cloud services categorized by their purpose

 - Azure is a public cloud provider(servers are shared), but it also offers private (dedicated servers), hybrid, and multi-cloud solutions to users
 - Azure offers over 200 services in about 20 various categories
 - Each Azure service has its unique purpose and is built to solve specific technical problems
 - Azure services can be seamlessly integrated with other services

# III. Azure Portal
 - It is a self-managed portal of Microsoft’s cloud platform that is portable and accessible from anywhere on any device

    b. Cloud Shell - a builtin CLI in Azure Portal
    c. Customizable dashboard
    d. Azure Cost Management service - for setting up spending limits and budget alerts
    e. Send Azure Support requests directly when you need assistance or help
    f. Azure Marketplace -  to search, purchase, and try out applications and services from other service providers including Microsoft partner companies
   
 - Accessed by Azure users on their: 
    a. Web browsers
    b. Azure mobile app

 - The URL of the Azure Portal is specific to the cloud where your organization is deployed in Microsoft Azure:
    a. For commercial use or Azure Public Cloud :  https://portal.azure.com
    b. For Azure United States Government Cloud :  https://portal.azure.us
    c. Azure Germany                            :  https://portal.microsoftazure.de
    d. Azure China                              :  https://portal.azure.cn

# IV. Different types of Core Services in Azure
 1. Compute Services                                        : provide computing resources like operating systems, networking, disks, processors, and memory
 2. Networking Services                                     : help secure both private and public cloud infrastructure by customizing their cloud networking setup and manage their network resources on demand
 3. Azure Storage Services                                  : offer great storage for any type of data objects
 4. Azure Database Services                                 : a great collection of database services to select from depending on the type of data structure you need for your organization: relational, NoSQL, in-memory databases, and other modern databases
 5. Identity Management and Security Services               : to secure your organization’s cloud resources against threats
 6. Developer Tools, Monitoring, and DevOps Services        : for cloud development, troubleshooting, monitoring, DevOps practices, infrastructure as code (IaC), and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD)
