# I. What is Azure ?
 - Microsoft Azure is Microsoft’s cloud computing platform
 - Azure: is a sky blue color and the typical color of “the cloud”
 - Historically
    a. Windows Azure - was originally built on Windows Server 2008 for developers who wanted to host their software applications in a Windows environment on the cloud
    b. In 2014, it was renamed Microsoft Azure
 - Azure is a public cloud provider(servers are shared), but it also offers private (dedicated servers), hybrid, and multi-cloud solutions to users
 - Azure offers over 200 services in about 20 various categories
 - Each Azure service has its unique purpose and is built to solve specific technical problems
 - Azure services can be seamlessly integrated with other services
 - It provides organizations/individuals with on-demand access to resources: to meet their needs
    a. Computing
    b. Storage
    c. Networking, and
    d. Many other resources

# II. Azure Global Cloud Infrastructure
 - Key concepts:
    1. Resource - a CPU, RAM, disk, GPU, network related etc.    
    2. Physical Server - has a set of resources (scalable if needed)
    3. Virtual Machine (Node) - using Virtualization tools
    4. Rack - contain rack servers or blade servers along with networking components
    5. Data center - a collection of racks
    6. Cluster - a collection of nodes connected to work on a specific task (these can span from one or more data centers)
      
 - Geo-distribution: Azure helps global enterprises by providing geo-distribution features. Geography-specific endpoints enables international enterprises to comply with regional compliance and regulations
 - Azure Geographies, Regions, Region Pairs, and Azure Availability Zones

## What are Availability Zones ?
 - A campus with one or more data centers with independent facilities for power, networking, cooling, and support
 - These zones are unique physical location or data centers within an Azure region that offer 99.99% SLA for virtual machine uptime
 - These availability zones are connected and equipped with secure high-speed networks, which is important in running mission-critical resources for your computing, networking, storage, and data
 - Availability zones are not available in all regions
   Ex. Central India Region has three AZs,
       South India Region has no AZs
 - Availability options on AZ level is not available in all Azure services
   Ex. Azure Virtual Machine Service has availability option on AZ level
 - Availability zones are used to protect resources from complete system failures in an Azure data center while Availability sets are used to protect applications from hardware failures within an Azure data center

## What are Azure Regions ?
 - Choosing the right Azure region is also important when it comes to regulatory compliance and data policies such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe
 - Types of Regions:
    a. Regions with Availability Zones (>= 3 zones)
    b. Regions without Availability Zones
 - Some Azure services are non-regional and don't require you to select a specific region or configure availability zone support, meaning they are designed for global availability and don't have a zonal deployment option
 - Examples of Azure Services:
    a. Services that do support Availability Zones (Regional services)
         i. Zonal Services          :  Ex. Azure Virtual Machines  - These services allow us to deploy resources across specific availability zones within a region for enhanced resilience 
        ii. Zone-Redundant Services :  Ex. Azure Storage (Standard, Premium, and Archive tiers)  - These services are automatically replicated across multiple availability zones, ensuring high availability even if one zone experiences an outage  
    b. Services that do not support Availability Zones (Non-regional services) - Ex. Microsoft Entra ID, Azure DevOps - These services are designed to be globally available and don't have a specific region or zone dependency

   
## What are Azure Geographies ?
 - Azure divides the world into Geographies—sets of regions grouped together for data residency, sovereignty, and compliance
 - Each Azure geography contains one or more regions and meets specific data residency and compliance requirements. 
 - Ex. India

# Example 1: India 
1. Azure Geography : India
2. Azure Regions   : 2 running (Central India, South India), 1 announced (India South Central @ Hyderabad)
    a. Central India        @ Pune (With Availability Zones)
    b. South India          @ Chennai (
    c. India South Central  @ Hyderabad (With AZs)


# Azure Regional Pair
 - It involves pairing a region with another region within the same geography but those regions must be at least 300 miles away
   Ex.
 - When possible, Azure prefers this minimum distance between physical data centers in a regional pair in case of natural disasters, widespread power outages, etc.
 - By pairing regions within the same geography, Azure can replicate customer's resources like servers, virtual machines, databases, and storage in another location in case of power outages, natural disasters, etc.
 - If a region in a pair goes down, the services would failover automatically to the other region in its region pair
 - An Azure region usually pairs with another region in the same geography
   Ex. 
 - For example if the region is in Europe, then it is expected that its region pair is also located within Europe
 - Many regions aren't paired, and instead use availability zones as their primary means of redundancy
 - In addition, many Azure services support geo-redundancy whether regions are paired or not
 - Types of Regions:
    1. Paired Regions
         a. Symmetrically paired - means that each region is bidirectionally paired with another region Ex. West US is paired with East US and East US is paired with West US
         b. Asymmetrically paired -  involve regions that are not bidirectionally paired Ex. 
    2. Non-paired regions
  - In the unlikely event of a geography-wide outage, the recovery of one region is prioritized out of every region pair

# III. Azure Portal
 - It is a self-managed portal of Microsoft’s cloud platform that is portable and accessible from anywhere on any device
    a. Basically a Web based GUI using which we can search, create, build, manage, and monitor Azure services and other cloud resources
    b. Cloud Shell - a builtin CLI in Azure Portal
    c. Customizable dashboard
    d. Azure Cost Management service - for setting up spending limits and budget alerts
    e. Send Azure Support requests directly when you need assistance or help
    f. Azure Marketplace -  to search, purchase, and try out applications and services from other service providers including Microsoft partner companies
   
 - Accessed by Azure users on their: 
    a. Web browsers
    b. Azure mobile app

 - The URL of the Azure Portal is specific to the cloud where your organization is deployed in Microsoft Azure:
    a. For commercial use or Azure Public Cloud :  https://portal.azure.com
    b. For Azure United States Government Cloud :  https://portal.azure.us
    c. Azure Germany                            :  https://portal.microsoftazure.de
    d. Azure China                              :  https://portal.azure.cn
