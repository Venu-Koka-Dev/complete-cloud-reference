# I. What is AWS ?
 - Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a platform of web services that offers solutions for computing, storing, and networking etc.
 - It provides various layers of abstraction
   1. Low level of abstraction   : we can attach volumes to a virtual machine
   2. High level of abstraction  : store and retrieve data via a REST API  
 - We can run all sorts of application on AWS by using one or a combination of services

## Relevance of AWS today 
 - The research firm Gartner has yet again classified AWS as a leader in their Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure & Platform Services in 2022
 - Gartner’s Magic Quadrant groups vendors into four quadrants—niche players, challengers, visionaries, and leaders

# II. How you can benefit from using AWS ?
1. Cost savings: Pay-per-use pricing model
2. Innovative and fast-growing platform: to generate valuable solutions for your customers and thus achieve a competitive advantage
3. Services solve common problems: just pick the right services to build complex systems
4. AWS is API driven: enables automation to set up an environment in the cloud based on our blueprints with the help of infrastructure as code
5. Flexible capacity (scalability): we switch on/off resources as we want
6. Built for failure (reliability): highly available or fault tolerant by default
7. Reducing time to market: development process will be faster because of the shorter feedback loops
8. Benefiting from economies of scale: AWS reduces prices for their cloud services every now and then
9. Global infrastructure: having low network latencies between your customers and your infrastructure, being able to comply with regional data protection requirements, and benefiting from different infrastructure prices in different regions
10. Professional partner: we can be sure that their quality and security follow the latest standards and certifications

# III. How much does it cost ?
 - Services are invoiced on a monthly basis
 - AWS Pricing Calculator: to calculate the monthly cost of a planned setup

## What is Free tier ?
 - One-year trial period 
 - To enable us to experiment with AWS and get some experience using its services
 - For the first 12 months of signing up:
    a. Some services are always free
       Ex. 
    b. Some services are free with limits
       Ex. the first 25 GB of the NoSQL database are free forever
    c. Some services are not free
       Ex.  
   

## What is Pay-as-you-go ?
 - Pay-per-use opportunities
 - We can be billed in the following ways:
    a. Based on time of use          — A virtual machine is billed per second. A load balancer is billed per hour
    b. Based on traffic/throughput   — Traffic is measured in gigabytes or in number of request
    c. Based on storage usage        — Usage can be measured by capacity (e.g., 50 GB volume no matter how much you use) or real usage (such as 2.3 GB used)

## Example: A typical web application billing

- We can achieve a linear relationship between traffic and costs
- If you were able to increase the number of visitors to your web shop fivefold in February: number of visitors increased from 100,000 to 500,000
- And your monthly bill increased from $112 to $473, which is a 4.2-fold increase

# IV. Exploring & interacting with AWS services
 - Around 200 services in 25 categories
 - New services are announced constantly during the year and at the big conference in Las Vegas, AWS re:Invent, which takes place annually in November
 - AWS cloud is composed of hardware and software services accessible via an API


## How can an AWS Administrator manage & access AWS services ?
Multiple ways:
1. AWS Management Console
    - Manual by filling up forms
      
2. AWS CLI tools
    - Manual/automate
      
3. AWS SDKs
    - Manual/automate
    - AWS offers SDKs for the following platforms and languages: JavaScript, Python, PHP, .NET, Ruby, Java, Go, Node.js, C++
    - SDKs are typically used to integrate AWS services into applications
    - If you’re doing software development and want to integrate an AWS service like a NoSQL database or a push-notification service, an SDK is the right choice for the job
    - Some services, such as queues and topics, must be used with an SDK
      
4. AWS Blueprints
![AWS Blueprints](../assets/aws-blueprints-demo.png)
    - Automate
    - A blueprint is a description of your system containing all resources and their dependencies
    - An Infrastructure as Code tool compares your blueprint with the current system and calculates the steps to create, update, or delete your cloud infrastructure
    - A blueprint is transferred into a running system
