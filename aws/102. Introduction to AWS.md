# I. What is AWS ?
 - Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a platform of web services that offers solutions for computing, storing, and networking etc.
 - It provides various layers of abstraction
   1. Low level of abstraction   : we can attach volumes to a virtual machine
   2. High level of abstraction  : store and retrieve data via a REST API  
 - We can run all sorts of application on AWS by using one or a combination of services

## Relevance of AWS today 
 - The research firm Gartner has yet again classified AWS as a leader in their Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure & Platform Services in 2022
 - Gartner’s Magic Quadrant groups vendors into four quadrants—niche players, challengers, visionaries, and leaders

# II. How you can benefit from using AWS ?
1. Cost savings: Pay-per-use pricing model
2. Innovative and fast-growing platform: to generate valuable solutions for your customers and thus achieve a competitive advantage
3. Services solve common problems: just pick the right services to build complex systems
4. AWS is API driven: enables automation to set up an environment in the cloud based on our blueprints with the help of infrastructure as code
5. Flexible capacity (scalability): we switch on/off resources as we want
6. Built for failure (reliability): highly available or fault tolerant by default
7. Reducing time to market: development process will be faster because of the shorter feedback loops
8. Benefiting from economies of scale: AWS reduces prices for their cloud services every now and then
9. Global infrastructure: having low network latencies between your customers and your infrastructure, being able to comply with regional data protection requirements, and benefiting from different infrastructure prices in different regions
10. Professional partner: we can be sure that their quality and security follow the latest standards and certifications

# III. How much does it cost ?
 - Services are invoiced on a monthly basis
 - AWS Pricing Calculator: to calculate the monthly cost of a planned setup

## What is Free tier ?
 - One-year trial period 
 - To enable us to experiment with AWS and get some experience using its services
 - For the first 12 months of signing up:
    a. Some services are always free
       Ex. 
    b. Some services are free with limits
       Ex. the first 25 GB of the NoSQL database are free forever
    c. Some services are not free
       Ex.  
   

## What is Pay-as-you-go ?
 - Pay-per-use opportunities
 - We can be billed in the following ways:
    a. Based on time of use          — A virtual machine is billed per second. A load balancer is billed per hour
    b. Based on traffic/throughput   — Traffic is measured in gigabytes or in number of request
    c. Based on storage usage        — Usage can be measured by capacity (e.g., 50 GB volume no matter how much you use) or real usage (such as 2.3 GB used)
