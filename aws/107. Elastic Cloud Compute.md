# I. What is Elastic Cloud Compute ?
 - With a virtual machine, you get access to a slice of a physical machine located in a data center
 - On AWS, virtual machines are offered by the service called Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

# What is Virtualization ?
![Types of Hypervisors](../assets/types-of-virtualization.png)
 
 - The physical machine is called the host machine, and the VMs running on it are called guests
 - A virtual machine (VM) runs on a physical machine isolated from other virtual machines by the hypervisor
 - A hypervisor is responsible for isolating the guests from each other and for scheduling requests to the hardware by providing a virtual hardware platform to the guest system
 - Types of Virtualization Softwares or Hypervisors:
    a. Type 1 hypervisors: also known as bare-metal hypervisors
        - They run directly on the host's hardware to control the hardware and manage guest operating systems
        - Ex. VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen (Citrix Hypervisor)
    b. Type 2 hypervisors: also known as hosted hypervisors
        - They run on top of a conventional operating system (like Windows, macOS, or Linux)
        - They rely on the host OS for device support and resource management
        - Ex. VMware Workstation, Oracle VM VirtualBox, Parallels Desktop (for macOS)
