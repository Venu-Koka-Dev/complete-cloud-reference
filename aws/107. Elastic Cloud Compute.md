![Types of Hypervisors](../assets/types-of-virtualization.png)

 - Types of Virtualization Softwares or Hypervisors:
    a. Type 1 hypervisors: also known as bare-metal hypervisors
        - They run directly on the host's hardware to control the hardware and manage guest operating systems
        - Ex. VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen (Citrix Hypervisor)
    b. Type 2 hypervisors: also known as hosted hypervisors
        - They run on top of a conventional operating system (like Windows, macOS, or Linux)
        - They rely on the host OS for device support and resource management
        - Ex. VMware Workstation, Oracle VM VirtualBox, Parallels Desktop (for macOS)
