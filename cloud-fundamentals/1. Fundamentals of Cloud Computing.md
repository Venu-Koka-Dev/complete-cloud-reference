# I. What is Cloud computing ?
 - It is a technology platform, that can benefit many audiences, addressing a need to access self-service, on-demand computing resources and services that are secure, governed, automated, elastic, and scalable, allowing the platform to cater to demand
 - Multi-tenant
 - Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with
   minimal management effort or service provider interaction
 - Essential characteristics of cloud model:
    a. On-demand self-service
    b. Broad network access
    c. Resource pooling
    d. Rapid elasticity
    e. Measured service

## Cloud platform providers
 - Microsoft, Amazon, Alibaba, and Google 
 - The value of a cloud provider platform is as an enabler of digital transformation and innovation
 - It provides :
    a. Quicker time to market and value
    b. Economies of scale, with an operating model that is governed, elastic, agile, and combined with a flexible cost model

## Evolution of Cloud computing architectures

 - Serverless computing : where the business logic layer is the new scale unit
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# III. The shared responsibility model
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IV. Cloud deployment models
1. Public Cloud
 - The public cloud operating model implements hardware and software at the cloud platform provider’s facilities, from which they create compute, storage, network, and other resources and services
 - These are made available to all tenants on the platform, who use their portion of the shared resources and services and are billed only for what they use (or consume)
 - The users of these multi-tenant (shared) computing platforms benefit through economies of scale, that is, cost reductions that can be passed on due to efficiencies in the scale of operation

2. Private Cloud

3. Hybrid Cloud
 - Many of these public cloud providers now offer hybrid cloud solutions
 - Meaning the hardware, software, services, and resources can also now sit in the customer’s locations, or even a third-party provider’s locations, with a control plane that operates over a network from the cloud provider’s platform locations
 - Microsoft’s examples of this are Azure Stack and Azure Arc
