# I. Setting up an account
1. Create an Email account
    a. Either use our own existing email account    Ex. eswarmuthyam24@gmail.com
    b. Or create a new Microsoft's Outlook or Hotmail email account  Ex. eswarmuthyam24@outlook.com
   
2. Create a Microsoft Account: eswarmuthyam24@gmail.com/Microsoft4$5account   
3. Create your Azure free subscription: use Phone number & Credit/Debit card

4. Add an organization in the website: https://aex.dev.azure.com/

5. How to plan organizations & projects in Azure DevOps - depends on the business use case
   
#### Use case 1: Creating a simple structure for a small company called Sifting Bytes Technolgies with a single business unit Academy
 - Create an Organization by going to:  https://aex.dev.azure.com
   Name: org-sbt

![A simple use case of a simple company having just one business unit](../assets/simple-org-proj.png)
![Link between Organization & Azure Active Directory](../assets/org-link-azure-ad.png)

 - Lets say we have a company called Sifting Bytes Technologies that offer online corportate trainings only
 - They need an Online Web application/platform which connects students & trainers
 - Azure DevOps organizations give you access to the Azure DevOps toolchain like Azure Boards, Azure Repos etc.
    a. Azure Boards     - To schedule and track your tasks and issues
    b. Azure Repos      - To work with software developers to build applications with source control management tools
    c. Azure Pipelines  - To set up continuous integration and deployment
    d. Azure Artifacts  - To cCreate, organize, and share packages
    e. Azure Test Plans - To test applications end to end 

 -  Create a Project: proj-sbt-webapp


#### Use case 2: Creating a more elaborate structure for a large company Sifting Bytes Technologies with multiple business units like Academy, Software services & E-commerce
 - Lets take an example of a company called Sifting Bytes Technologies
 - We can multiple projects in in each organization
 - Projects focus on different things
 - They all exist under the organization, which is connected to a single Azure Active Directory tenant
 - This company has three business units:
    a. Academy            - offering corporate trainings
    b. Software Services  - offering various software services to companies
    c. E-commerce         - offering B2C platform to sell office & sports related products

6. Create a project in the Organization
Note: On successful creation of the organization, Azure DevOps routes you to a page where you can create projects in your new organization

Project Name: ProjectSbtWebApp -> Visibility: Private (we need to give access to users manually) -> Create Project -> Dashboard with all the possible actions we can perform in the project -> This is the starting point for everything we do

![Project dashboard](../assets/project-dashboard.png)

Note: We can also add a new project to an existing organization from the organization dashboard

# II.  What is Azure DevOps Organization(s) ?
 - What is an Organization in Azure DevOps?  
 - An Azure DevOps organization is a tool for organizing and joining related projects
 - We can plan and track our work here and collaborate with others when developing applications
 - From the organization level, we can also integrate with other services, set permissions accordingly, and set up continuous integration and deployment
 - Azure DevOps organizations give you access to the Azure DevOps toolchain like Azure Boards, Azure Repos etc. 
 - Different Azure DevOps organizations can have varying security and structural models
 - Each organization is connected to a single Azure Active Directory tenant i.e. it means that team members working on any of these projects all have access to that tenant
 - We can have one or more than one organizations for our company i.e. how we structure/plan our organization depends on our use case
 - For example, our company Flipkart:
    a. Company-wide organization                                 Ex. Single organization called org-flipkart-ecomm   
    b. It can be for specific business units in your company     Ex. Multiple organizations like org-web-app, org-analytics-business

#### How can we structure/plan an Azure DevOps organization for a Company/Client 
 - Lets take an example of a company called Sifting Bytes Technologies
 - This company has three business units:
    a. Academy            - offering corporate trainings
    b. Software Services  - offering various software services to companies
    c. E-commerce         - offering B2C platform to sell office & sports related products 

Use case 1: Single Organization in Azure DevOps
 - We have a single Azure DevOps organization called: org-sbt
 - We can have multiple projects called:
     a. proj-sbt-academy
     b. proj-sbt-soft-sols
     c. proj-sbt-ecomm


Use case 2: Multiple Organizations in Azure DevOps
 - We can have multiple Azure DevOps organizations:
    a. org-sbt-academy
    b. org-sbt-soft-sols
    c. org-sbt-ecomm
 - We can multiple projects in in each organization
 - Projects focus on different things
 - They all exist under the organization, which is connected to a single Azure Active Directory tenant
 - Lets say, the organization org-sbt-ecomm can have multiple projects: team members working on any of these projects all have access to that tenant  
    a. proj-web-app
    b. proj-mob-app
    c. proj-customer-analytics-app

# III. What is Azure DevOps Project(s) ?
 - What is a Project in Azure DevOps ?
 - A project is a store for data in Azure DevOps
 - Each organization can have many projects

#### Use case 1 : When to go for a Single Project in an organization ?
 - A single project places all work at one level across the organization
 - In a single project, teams can share source repositories, build definitions, release definitions, reports, and package sources
 - You may have a large product or service managed by multiple teams
 - These teams are closely interdependent throughout the product life cycle
 - You create a project and divide your work using team and area paths
 - This setting allows your teams to see each other's work, thus aligning the organization
 - Your team uses the same taxonomy to track work items, making communication and alignment easier
 - Having a single project is good for transparency, but it has its drawbacks
 - As it is hard to find what you're looking for with multiple searches and boards
 - Depending on the product architecture, this issue may spread to other areas such as releases, builds, and repositories.

#### Use case 2: When to go for multiple projects in an organization ?
 - Having multiple projects shifts the managerial burden and gives the team more autonomy to manage projects as they see fit. It also provides access to asset and security controls within projects.
 - You may use multiple projects if your organization satisfies one or more of these requirements:
    a. You want to restrict or control access to information in the projects within your organization.
    b. Your organization likes to use custom techniques for tracking work items and tasks for its distinctive business units.
    c. Your organization wants to support respective business units with their own managed policies.
    d. Your organization may want to add custom tests or extensions before making changes to a project you're working on.

# IV. Walkthrough of the key features of the Project Dashboard

![Project dashboard](../assets/project-dashboard.png)

1. Azure Boards
    a. Software development teams can use the interactive and configurable tools in Azure Boards for managing their software projects\
    b. It delivers various features, including support for agile and scrum, customizable dashboards, and reporting
    c. As your business grows, you can scale these tools.

3. Azure Repos:
    a. It is a collection of version control and source code management tools
    b. Version control tools are applications that help you track changes you make in your code in real time. As you update your code, you tell the version control tool to take a snapshot of your files. The version control tool saves that snapshot, and you can retrieve it later when needed.

5. Azure Pipelines: To instantly build and test code to make them available to others. It combines CI and CD to test, build, and deploy your code to any target or destination.

6. Azure Test Plans: A test management platform with all the abilities required for different testing styles and gathering feedback from stakeholders (including planned manual testing, user acceptance testing, and exploratory testing)

7. Azure Artifacts
    a. It allows software developers to share their code effectively and handle all their packaged code from one place
    b. Developers can publish packages to their feeds and share them within the same team, across multiple product teams or organizations, and even publicly

8. Visual Studio Marketplace
    a. To download extensions for Azure DevOps
    b. Created by Microsoft, in collaboration with the tech community
    c. They are add-ons that customize and advance your team's venture with Azure DevOps
    d. They can expand different parts of the DevOps toolchain, from managing work items to code integration and testing, pipeline builds and software releases, and team synergy
