## 1. Azure DevOps Services
 - This web-based service has a service-level agreement of at least 99.9 percent uptime, making it reliable
 - Azure DevOps services are also globally distributed
 - Scoping happens by organizations and projects
 - Authentication happens over the Internet with your Microsoft account credentials or Azure Active Directory credentials
 - Data protection: All your data, including projects, source codes, and plans, exist on Azure
 - Simplified server management
 - Access to the latest features
 - Improved connectivity with remote sites
 - 

## 2. Azure DevOps Server
 - Azure DevOps Server's backing foundation is a customizable SQL server backend
 - For organizations that want all their data only on their own networks for business reasons (security, governance & compliances)
 - Scoping happens by deployments, project collections, and projects
 - Authentication happens on an intranet server (Microsoft ADDS) & we authenticate with Windows Authentication and your Active Directory domain credentials
 - Data Protection: all your data exists on the on-premise servers your organization uses, and administrators control everything

# Getting Started



Software as a service (SaaS): A cloud service model where the cloud provider runs and manages the application together with its infrastructure. Here, a lot is abstracted from the customer, who cares only about what they use.
DevOps engineering: The implementation of DevOps practices in software development teams.
DevSecOps: The integration of security into every stage of the DevOps process.
Site reliability engineering: A set of practices that merges software engineering with application monitoring to make sure that deployed applications always maintain high availability.
