Differences Between Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server
The differences between these two Azure DevOps offerings can be grouped into the following:

Scoping
Authentication
Users and group
User access management
Data protection
Scoping
In Azure DevOps Services, scoping happens by organizations and projects. Organizations in Azure DevOps Services have URLs, and this is where everyone's collaboration journey starts. These organizations contain their group of projects. Each project can be developed and supported by the different teams in the organization, and team members need to operate in the project environment only.

With Azure DevOps Server, scoping happens by deployments, project collections, and projects. In straightforward terms, a deployment is a server. Project collections are containers that exist in deployments. These containers are for security, administration, and physical database boundaries. They're also used to group related projects. Finally, projects encapsulate the different parts of individual software projects, including source code, work items, and more.

Authentication
Azure Active Directory is an identity and access management service.

In Azure DevOps Services, authentication happens over the Internet. Authentication happens with your Microsoft account credentials or Azure Active Directory credentials, depending on your organization's setup. You can also set up Azure Active Directory to require various features such as multifactor authentication, IP address restrictions, and more.

With Azure DevOps Server, authentication happens on an intranet server. You authenticate with Windows Authentication and your Active Directory domain credentials. This process is transparent.

Users and Group
Imagine a tech company that conducts multiple types of business for other organizations (business-to-business) and end users (business-to-consumers). In this organization, there could be different projects for different teams. For example, say there is the team building the SDKs and APIs (let's call them Alpha), the team building a customer-facing application (let's call them Diamond), and the team building and maintaining the company's website (let's call them Gamma).

In Azure DevOps Services, you can use an authentication method to give access to a collection of users. Use user groups to represent different teams in an organization. Using the scenario described, you can create Azure Active Directory User Groups for Alpha, Diamond, and Gamma. Teammates can join the user groups they belong to, and access to projects and resources for everyone is managed at the user group level. You can add these Azure Active Directory user groups to Azure DevOps Services groups.

In Azure DevOps Server, each deployment implements the user access methodology. Users can join Active Directory groups, and administrators can add these Active Directory groups to the different Azure DevOps groups. These user group memberships are consistent. So, when user access gets updated in Active Directory, it shows in the permissions the user has in that organization.

User Access Management
Beyond authentication, authorization exists to enforce that users have access to resources. This process happens by assigning roles and access levels to users. For example, a user with an Admin role will have permission to do more than a user with a Contributor role.

In Azure DevOps Services, each user has an access level, and they revalidate anytime they sign in. These users interact with resources only at the level specified, and that interaction happens on the Azure cloud.

In Azure DevOps Server, users have access levels, but everything happens from the primary system. Once the access level is specified, in addition to authentication, authorization occurs on the intranet server.

Data Protection
In Azure DevOps Services, all your data, including projects, source codes, and plans, exist on Azure. Projects in Azure DevOps Services are safe and secure.

In Azure DevOps Server, all your data exists on the on-premise servers your organization uses, and administrators control everything.

Similarities Between Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server
Although the cloud and on-premise offerings for Azure DevOps have some differences, they share some similarities as well.

Features
The cloud and on-premise offerings for Azure DevOps use the same components for code builds and releases, source code control, tasks management, test plans, and artifact administration.

Analytics and Reporting
Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server offer numerous tools that give you perspicuity into the activity and improvement of your software projects. Some of those tools include the following:

Dashboards and lightweight charts exist in both the cloud and on-premises platforms. These tools aid in data visualization for various projects.
Power BI is an interactive tool for visualizing data created by Microsoft, concentrated on business intelligence. Power BI integration helps teams to get analytics data into Power BI reports. With this, you will be able to analyze and visualize data from Power BI.
OData support makes it easy for teams to instantly query the analytics service through the browser. Your product team can use the query result JSON as they want. You can generate queries that span many projects or your entire organization.
Process Customization
Both tools use the inheritance process model to customize their work-tracking experience. These customizations can happen instantly on the user interface or programmatically by calling the REST API endpoints.
