# II. What are Azure Boards ?
 - Azure Boards is designed to facilitate Agile project management i.e. allowing teams to efficiently plan, execute, and monitor their work throughout the software development lifecycle
 - It is a service within Azure DevOps that provides tools for work tracking, including boards and backlogs
 - This enables the definition, tracking, and organization of work that needs to be completed
 - Teams can :
    a. Outline their tasks to create a visual representation of their workflow and priorities
    b. Design customizable dashboards
    c. Integrated reporting capabilities and tools
    b. Integrating with GitHub - an issue can be raised to suggest innovative ideas or track bugs
       These issues can then be systematically organized and assigned within teams, ensuring clear communication and task management

   


Boards and backlogs for project planning using the agile or scrum methodology
Code build and release pipelines for continuous integration and deployment
Code repositories for version control and management of source code
Repositories for built and sharable artifacts
Continuous test plans for the entire project life cycle

# III. What are Processes & Process templates ?
 - At the start of the project, teams must decide which process and process templates need to be used to support the project model that is being used
 - Work Item tracking system 
 - Types of process templates supported by Azure Boards: native support for Scrum and Kanban
    a. Basic
    b. Agile
    c. Scrum
    d. (CMMI) Capability Maturity Model Integration

## 1. Basic 
 - Uses Epics, Issues, and Tasks to track the work
 - These artifacts are created when you create a new basic project:
    a. Portfolio backlog - contains Epics
    b. Product backlog   - contains Issues
    c. Tasks

## 2. Agile
 - Development and test activities are tracked separately here
 - These artifacts are created when you create a new basic project:
    a. Portfolio backlog - contains Epics & Features
    b. Product backlog   - contains User stories & tasks, bug & tasks
    c. Issues 
 - Agile uses the Kanban board to track User Stories and bugs
 - We can also track them on the task board

## 3. Scrum
 - These artifacts are created when you create a new basic project:
    a. Portfolio backlog - contains Epics
    b. Product backlog   - contains Isses
    c. Tasks
 - We can track artifacts using the Kanban board or break PBIs and bugs down into tasks on the task board

## 4. (CMMI) Capability Maturity Model Integration
 - A more formal project method that requires a framework for process improvement and an auditable record of decisions
 - We can track requirements and change requests, risks, and reviews
