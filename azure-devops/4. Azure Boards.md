 Azure Boards, a service within Azure DevOps that provides tools for work tracking, including boards and backlogs. This enables the definition, tracking, and organization of work that needs to be completed. 
Teams can outline their tasks using Azure Boards to create a visual representation of their workflow and priorities. Additionally, for those integrating with GitHub, an issue can be raised to suggest innovative ideas or track bugs. 
These issues can then be systematically organized and assigned within teams, ensuring clear communication and task management. Azure Boards is designed to facilitate agile project management, allowing teams to efficiently plan, execute, and monitor 
their work throughout the software development lifecycle
